## Project Overview

Customer churn prediction is essential for understanding customer behavior and implementing strategies to retain valuable clients. This project demonstrates a step-by-step approach to predict customer churn, covering:

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Feature selection and one-hot encoding
- Model training and evaluation

## Installation

To run this project, you need Python 3.x and the following libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Dataset

The dataset (`Churn_Modelling.csv`) contains customer information with various features such as customer demographics, account balance, and credit score, used to predict churn likelihood. Make sure to place this dataset in the same directory as the notebook or update the file path accordingly.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-churn-prediction.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd customer-churn-prediction
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   Open `churn_prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab and execute the cells step-by-step to understand and replicate the churn prediction process.

## Modeling Techniques

The project includes:

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Dropping irrelevant columns, encoding categorical data, and normalizing numerical features.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Potential models include Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, or other classifiers as suited for churn prediction.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to assess model performance.

## Results

The notebook includes an evaluation section where results are displayed. Accuracy and other relevant metrics are presented to illustrate model effectiveness.
